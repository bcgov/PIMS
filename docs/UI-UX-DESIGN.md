Tips for using the UXPin simulate function.

- Ensure "Simulate" at the top center of the page is active (blue).

- You can view the sitemap to jump to a desired page by clicking on the "Sitemap:..." at the upper left corner.

- You must use the sitemap to jump from any regular user page to an administrator page.
