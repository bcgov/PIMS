# Code Quality

All effort has been made to ensure the code and architecture of the PIMS solution is of the highest quality.
All Stories with testable features require unit-tests to be created and auto-run in all builds of the DevOps pipeline.
Best practices and standards are followed and enforced through continual peer-review and code-review.

## Tools

There are a number of tools used to aid code quality.
