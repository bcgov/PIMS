# PIMS
Property Inventory Management System




## Introduction:

Strategic Real Estate Services (SRES), formerly known as Release of Assets for Economic Generation, is comprised of professionals from a variety of backgrounds (sales, marketing, First Nations consultation, environmental management and communications) was formed to dispose of assets surplus to government, in order to help government meet its commitment to balance the provincial budget, and to generate economic activity in communities throughout BC.  The SRES team is tasked with coordinating the province-wide management of this initiative ensuring that all issues are addressed appropriately and the return to government is maximized.

SRES is responsible for:

- maintaining a complete inventory of titled real estate assets
- marketing property internally for repurposing (transfer to another ministry)
- First Nations Consultation and Accomodations as related to disposal of real estate assets 
- providing strategic real estate analysis and advice to Ministries and Broader Public Sectors 


To support SRES’s overall strategic real estate initiatives a modern Information Management System is required that will aid in strategic decision making, support its client Ministries and the Broader Public Sector, and remain compliant with current Inventory Policies (CPPM Policy Chapter 8: Asset Management).  Ideally the system will be flexible to allow for ad hoc customized reporting and adaptable to support unforeseen future real estate strategies.

## Problem Statement:

The inability for SRES to rely on it’s current system, data and processes to analyze real estate data in an accurate and efficient way impacts SRES ability to be the source of truth for strategic real estate information, analysis and advice. (Draft Problem Statement) 

## Goal:

To create a dynamic, map enabled, customer relationship and property inventory system to manage titled properties through the government property ownership life cycle from acquisition to disposal (transfer to another ministry or sale outside of the government). This would include the ability to manage internal workflows. PIMS will be capable of collection, analysis, and reporting of spatial data and related asset information from multiple data sources.

The system would promote strategic portfolio management approach to the administration of government real property by consolidating Provincial real estate information into one searchable inventory with a GIS functionality to incorporate mapping.

Ideally reporting and query requirements would allow SRES staff to run technical detailed reports through the GIS and linked database.  Simple query, collaboration and reporting should be available to non-technical users such as external stakeholders.

Objectives include:
- Increase the total amount of properties in the inventory Map 
- Ensure data validation occurs at time of project submission – BC Assessment and/or Land Title Survey Authority 
- Increase client satisfaction with system
- Allow for portals for clients to add, edit, and report on properties in the system 
- Accurate, customizable, instant financial reporting 
- Seamless data migration from clients to PIMS
