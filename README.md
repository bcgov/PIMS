Property Inventory Management System

##Introduction
To support SRESâ€™s overall strategic real estate initiatives a modern Information Management System is required that will aid in strategic decision making, support its client Ministries and the Broader Public Sector, and remain compliant with current Inventory Policies (CPPM Policy Chapter 8: Asset Management).  Ideally the system will be flexible to allow for ad hoc customized reporting and adaptable to support unforeseen future real estate strategies.
