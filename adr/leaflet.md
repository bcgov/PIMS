> January 1, 2020

## Context

The project requires a GIS component to display a map, properties on the map and property boundaries.

The following options were reviewed;

- [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [Data BC](https://data.gov.bc.ca/)
- [LTSA](https://ltsa.ca/)

## Decision

The PIMS project will use Leaflet for the basic GIS solution.

## Consequences

Leaflet only offers a few features and performance isn't spectacular.
Using Leaflet is the simplest and most efficient option.
It is free to use.
Only requires making requests to their API.
