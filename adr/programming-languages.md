# Programming Languages

## Status

> Accepted

> January 1, 2020

## Context

We need to choose programming languages for our software. We have two major needs: a front-end programming language suitable for web applications, and a back-end programming language suitable for server applications.

The languages selected should be part of the skillset and expierence of the team members.
They should have broad industry support.
They should be supported by GIS related plugins, libraries and tools.

## Decision

We are choosing TypeScript and React for the front-end.

We are choosing .NET Core 3.1 for the back-end API.

## Consequences

Not all team members have TypeScript and React experience.
This however is also a benefit in the sense they will now have an opportunity.
