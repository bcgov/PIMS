        # For future reference, if we have N test projects the flow of events would be:
        #
        # **Pre-conditions:**
        # - All projects export their individual coverage percents in JSON and OpenCover format
        # - There's no way to merge OpenCover xmls together (that I could find)
        # - Common folder "../TestResults" is  git ignored so nothing gets in source control
        #
        # **Steps:**
        #
        # - Test-project 1
        #   - generate coverage files (without merging)
        #   - copy results to common folder "../TestResults"
        # - Test-project 2
        #   - generate coverage files merging with previous `coverage.json`
        #   - the previous `coverage.opencoverage.xml` is ignored
        #   - copy results to common folder "../TestResults"
        # ...
        # - Test-project N
        #   - generate coverage files merging with previous `coverage.json`
        #   - the previous `coverage.opencoverage.xml` is ignored
        #   - copy results to common folder "../TestResults"
        #
        # The final `coverage.opencover.xml` is the one we want
