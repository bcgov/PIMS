      The map provides a way to visually find properties that belong to your agency, or
      sub-agencies, along with any properties currently in the Enhanced Referral Program (ERP). If
      there are too many properties grouped together, it will create a cluster. You can click on the
      cluster and it will zoom in. You can filter the results by entering an Address, Location,
      PID/PIN, SPP No., Agency, Classification, Minimum Lot Size, Maximum Lot Size, and whether the
      property is on the Surplus Property Program (SPP).
